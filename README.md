# Web-Scraping-Challenge
In this this repository, the file named "Mars Mission Data", contains 3 files. Two of the files are my juypter notebooks that contains all the coding I have done necessary for my assignment. Part 1 consists of me Scraping the titles and preview text from Mars news articles. Part 2 is where I started Scraping web page to analyse the Mars weather data, which exists in a table. Then at the end of the part 2, I was instructed to make a CSV file out of the data obtained while analysing the web page. I have succesfully done that and have named "Mars_weather_df".
